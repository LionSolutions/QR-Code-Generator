QR-Code-Generator
=================

This is a QR Code Generator I made when I was still in highschool. It took me around 2 months to complete during the school term. It is written entirely in C#.

Please feel free to contribute to this project, adding new encoding techiniques or fixing the character limit of 176 chars.

----------------------

I choose this project because I wanted to challenge myself. I wanted to learn something new and follow an open standard to create a project which had an unbelievable complexity. (for my ability at the time when I completed it)
